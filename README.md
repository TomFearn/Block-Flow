## Overview

This is our version of Classic Tetris. We made this for our first Hackathon project of our Code Insitute course.
Using frontend technologies we chose to make a game out of the options provided. The project consists of one HTML file,
one JavaScript file, a stylesheet and a readME. Furthermore, we implemented the bootstrap framework to position the index.html
contents for the webpage.

#### What is tetris?

Tetris is a classic arcade game where the player is given randomly selected blocks that move down the screen. Each block is made of 4 cells and can be moved left, right, or down, and rotated. A block stops moving when one of its cells contacts another cell in the game area. The player scores points by filling a row with cells. When a row is filled, it is cleared, and the cells above move down, increasing the player's score. The game continues until there is no room to add new shapes. The player's score is then compared to the high score, which is updated if the player's score is higher.
