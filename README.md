## Overview

This is our version of Classic Tetris. We made this for our first Hackathon project of our Code Insitute course.
Using frontend technologies we chose to make a game out of the options provided. The project consists of one HTML file,
one JavaScript file, a stylesheet and a readME. Furthermore, we implemented the bootstrap framework to position the index.html
contents for the webpage.

#### What is tetris?

Tetris is a classic arcade game where the player is given randomly selected blocks that move down the screen. Each block is made of 4 cells and can be moved left, right, or down, and rotated. A block stops moving when one of its cells contacts another cell in the game area. The player scores points by filling a row with cells. When a row is filled, it is cleared, and the cells above move down, increasing the player's score. The game continues until there is no room to add new shapes. The player's score is then compared to the high score, which is updated if the player's score is higher.

## Project Development

### Our Approach

We chose to use Google meets to conistently check in with eachother throughout the day. We would allocate and decide what parts of the project we should tackle next. We would also make use of sharing the screen with each other when we needed to talk through an issue. This meant that all team members were able to work together and avoid conflicts.  


>### Key Successes
>
>We mostly avoided merge conflicts as we set up our project together in a clear structure and by using communication and regularly pulling from the updated main branch to be adding our code to the most up to date version.
>
>We planned well and we had an agreed approach to the project which helped to make the development process easier.

>### Challenges we Faced
>
>#### Minor issues
>- We had used different variable names


## Project Deployment

To deploy our tetris game we used GitHub pages which is a free platform to host webpages. We deployed as early as possible and we first published when we had our MVP (minimum viable product).

## Testing

#### Validation

#### Lighthouse test

#### Responsiveness Test

#### Manual Tests

## Impact of AI

### What AI tools did we use?

We used the GitHub co-pilot extension mainly using the chat window but also the in-line prompting.

### What did we use it for?

We used AI for debugging adn to explain any bugs and suggest possible fixes to these issues.

#### Here is an Example:
 
>__Bug__: we had a bug where the game loop would throw an error when the block reached the bottom of the play area.
>
>__Co-pilot Explanation__: the function used for checking for indexes that were out of range
>
>__Actions taken__: Co-pilot also suggested a quick one line fix to check that the index was within the correct range and once it had explained the code to us it was implemented.

We were also able to use the chat feature to explain code that others had written to get a faster understanding of our current progress in the project and to ensure that any features added were compatible with the other features the team had implemented.

### <ins>Summary</ins>

The AI tools used did have a positive impact on our project. They significantly improved our efficiency by providing quick explanations to bugs and offering code explanations. This allowed us to focus more on developing the key features rather than spending excessive time debugging. The ability to quickly understand and integrate each other's code through AI explanations also enhanced our collaboration and productivity.
